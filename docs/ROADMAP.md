# Research Roadmap — From Corruption Grid to a Methods Paper

*Created 2026-10-01. Synthesizes the advisor's three memos (candidate directions,
architecture-agnostic directions, free-tier compute plan) with the current state of
this repo. All GPU work assumes free-tier Colab/Kaggle (METHODS §11); total GPU cost
of the recommended path fits in ~2–3 weeks of Kaggle quota (30 h/week).*

*Last updated 2026-10-10: Track 2 v9 DONE at n=3 (3 ViT-B LoRA arms × seeds 42/43/44,
kernel `vitb-lora-v9` — drift-weighted at parity with uniform while training 24% fewer
params, RESEARCH §6.5); Track 0 residual (deterministic-noise) closed by agreement
(`DIVERGENCE_REPORT` §8.5).
Before that (10-08): Track 0 closed (PR #1 merged upstream `9bc6b50`, blur re-evals
folded), Track 1 gate run (NO-GO, fallback adopted), Track 2 v8 done (ViT-B profile);
Tracks 3–6 remain open.*

## 0. Where we stand (assets on the table)

- **Proven diagnostic**: per-module CKA drift profiles (ViT-S, 4 corruptions; biased +
  unbiased estimator agreement; CPU↔T4 determinism to 1e-6).
- **Proven allocation**: drift-weighted LoRA = uniform at 0.78% params, 3 seeds; big
  wins on frequency-destroying corruptions (jpeg +19.3, blur +17.7, low_light +22);
  graceful degradation on contrast (the rule is honest).
- **Proven decomposition**: readout staleness is real (+25.3 pp @sev4) but features
  are the bottleneck (plateau 0.377 vs 0.913 clean).
- **The gap the advisor confirmed**: real darkness barely hurts frozen DINOv2 on
  classification (ExDark flat, CLAHE +0.001) → the *problem* needs real benchmarks
  where darkness hurts (ACDC night, Dark Zurich, DarkFace/BDD-night, detection), and
  the *scale* needs more model families (not just one ViT-S on CIFAR-10).
- Landed since this roadmap was written: **PR #1 merged upstream** (2026-10-01,
  `9bc6b50` — fork replayed onto the rewritten root; `paper/`, `src/`, `tests/`, CI,
  `configs/` integrated), **blur re-evals folded** (`67a2dc4`), **Track 2 v8 ViT-B
  profile done** (  `6a9de11`, T4 259 s), **Track 2 v9 ViT-B LoRA arms done at n=3** (`output/v9_lora/`).
  Open: Tracks 3–6.

**Decision (advisor's two rankings converge on this):** the paper is **Drift-Profiled
Adaptation (DPA) + Selective Statistic Recalibration (SSR)** — the "drift-profiled,
label-free adaptation framework". Illumination-Routed Adapters (advisor's other #1)
is absorbed as the **end-game ablation** of DPA rather than a separate paper: routing
derived from the layer-drift diagnostic *is* DPA applied to adapter routing.
Illumination Registers and the Canonicalizer are parked (Archive, §5).

## 1. Priorities and rationale (what order, and why)

| # | Track | Why this position |
|---|-------|-------------------|
| 0 | ~~Close sessionE blur arms; PR #1 follow-through~~ — **closed** | blur re-evals folded (`67a2dc4`); PR #1 merged upstream (`9bc6b50`) |
| 1 | **Drift-proxy pipeline on ResNet-50** (advisor's "suggested next step") | **the whole paper stands or falls here**, for ~1 GPU-session; validates "cheap proxy ≈ CKA" outside ViT |
| 2 | **ViT-B drift-weighted LoRA** (kernel v8/v9) | the one remaining novelty claim from the *current* paper; also the ViT-family data point for the cross-architecture claim |
| 3 | **Cross-family drift profiles** (6 models) | the reviewer-ungettable result: *shape* of drift profiles across CNN/ViT/hybrid/state-space |
| 4 | **SSR: selective test-time recalibration** | label-free, inference-only, fits free tier; combines with DPA into the framework paper |
| 5 | **Real-darkness dense-task eval** (ACDC/Dark Zurich) | answers the "synthetic problem" objection on the benchmarks where darkness actually hurts |
| 6 | Manuscript assembly | after 1–5 produce the three claim pillars (cross-family, selective, real-dark) |
| A | Archive: routed adapters (as ablation), registers, canonicalizer | revisit only after the framework paper is out |

## 2. Track details

### Track 0 — Hygiene (closed: blur re-evals folded; PR #1 merged upstream)
- [x] Blur re-evals folded into METHODS §7.6 / RESEARCH §6.3 / README (`67a2dc4`).
- [x] **PR #1 merged 2026-10-01** (`9bc6b50`): the fork's 14 commits replayed onto
  upstream's rewritten root; `paper/`, `src/`, `tests/`, CI and `configs/` integrated
  (DIVERGENCE_REPORT's "configs not ported" note is obsolete — the manifest arrived
  with the merge); `docs/DIVERGENCE_REPORT.md` shipped inside the PR. `main` sits on
  the merged lineage — no rebase cleanup left to do.
- [x] Optional, non-blocking: deterministic-noise follow-up (flagged in PR #1) —
  **closed 2026-10-09**: reconciliation verdict in `docs/DIVERGENCE_REPORT.md` §8.5.
  The two primitives coexist by pipeline (content-keyed noise for the merged `src/`
  runners; seeded `1000 + severity` matched-noise for every committed fork artifact);
  merging them would re-noise all committed results — blocked by byte-comparability
  (AGENTS rule 3) absent an explicit re-baseline. Protocol stands.

### Track 1 — Drift-proxy feasibility (the gate; ~1 GPU-session + CPU analysis)
**Goal:** a drift proxy *much cheaper than CKA* that predicts where adaptation pays off,
agreement-checked against CKA on a model with a different architecture (ResNet-50).

- Proxy candidates (all forward-only, no backprop): per-module activation-energy drop
  (‖Δact‖² / ‖act‖² clean→degraded), per-module feature-statistics shift (mean/cov
  distance), cosine-of-activations (cheapest possible CKA relative).
- **Go/no-go gate:** rank correlation (Spearman) between proxy profile and CKA profile
  ≥ 0.8 on ≥ 2 corruptions; and top-k modules by proxy contain the top-k by CKA.
- Deliverable: `run_drift_proxy.py` (hooks on all modules, proxy + CKA + agreement
  report) + `docs/DPA_DESIGN.md` §1.
- [x] **Gate RUN (2026-10-03, CPU, CIFAR-10 test n=1000 seed 42, severity 5): NO-GO.**
  Best proxy `cos_drop`: ρ = 0.752 (blur) / 0.676 (low_light) — under the 0.8 bar on
  both corruptions (energy_drop 0.68/0.66; mean_shift ≈ 0; cov_shift ≈ 0 at n=1000).
  Same verdict on a ViT-S/14 harness check (n=300; energy_drop ρ ≈ 0.70 both) — the
  shortfall is not ResNet-specific. Two mechanistic findings: (a) CKA is
  scale-invariant while every candidate except cos_drop is scale-sensitive, and
  low-light amplitude shrink does NOT drive late-stage CKA drop — the drift CKA sees
  is structural, which amplitude statistics cannot rank; (b) mean_shift is structurally
  blind for blur (exactly 0 at every 1×1-conv downsample: Gaussian blur preserves DC).
  **Fallback adopted per plan: full CKA stays the profiler** (forward-only, proven);
  paper claim = "single cheap profiling pass", not "cheap proxy". Harness itself is
  validated and model-agnostic (`output/drift_proxy/`, `output/drift_proxy_dinov2_check/`).
- Fallback if it fails: keep full CKA as the profiler (it is forward-only anyway and
  already proven); the paper claim weakens to "single cheap profiling pass" instead of
  "cheap proxy". **The paper does not die here.**
- [x] `docs/DPA_DESIGN.md` §1 (after the §6 prior-art searches; records the gate outcome
  above as the profiler-selection evidence, the allocation-signal taxonomy, and the
  SSR adjacency; §2–§5 stubs pending Tracks 2–4).
- Note: ResNet-50 profile itself is strongly late-heavy under both corruptions
  (layer4.2 CKA drop 0.64 blur / 0.79 low_light vs layer1 0.06/0.14) — first CNN data
  point for Track 3's cross-architecture story; attn/mlp sub-modules of ViT-S also
  profiled by the same harness (Track 3 granularity for free).

### Track 2 — ViT-B drift-weighted LoRA (kernels v8 + v9; ~2–4 GPU-hours)
- [x] **v8 DONE (2026-10-03, kernel `vitb-drift-profile` v1, T4, 259 s):** ViT-B/14
  CKA+proxy profile, low_light + jpeg, severities 1–5, n=1000 (`output/vitb_profile/`;
  harness = `run_drift_profile.py`, the Tracks 2+3 shared sweep runner). Findings:
  (a) gate NO-GO on a third architecture with the same signature — cos_drop ρ=0.88 on
  jpeg vs 0.68 on low_light (scale-invariance diagnosis now spans ResNet-50, ViT-S,
  ViT-B); (b) **MLP sublayers drift more than attention** under photometric corruption
  (all 12 blocks, both corruptions; sev-5 low_light: blocks.10.mlp 0.916 vs
  blocks.10.attn 0.878, blocks.11.mlp 0.902 vs blocks.11.attn 0.847) — sublayer
  resolution the ViT-S whole-block CKA could not see; (c) block-level profiles
  late-heavy (b9–b11 0.80–0.87 low_light; 0.71–0.79 jpeg), consistent with ViT-S.
  Folded into RESEARCH §5.1 / METHODS §7.8. v9 allocation inputs:
  `drift_profile_sev5_{low_light,jpeg}.csv` — NOTE: rows cover all 37 profiled modules
  (patch_embed, blocks.k, blocks.k.attn/mlp); the LoRA consumer needs the 12
  blocks.k rows re-indexed 0–11.
- [x] **v9 DONE at n=3 (2026-10-09/10, kernels `vitb-lora-v9` v1+v2, T4, ~3.5 h total,
  exit 0 both):** 3 arms × seeds 42/43/44 × low_light, epochs 10, 5,000 CIFAR-10 imgs,
  70% aug (the Phase-3 v2 seed protocol) — per-arm logs/plots in `output/v9_lora/`,
  9 rows in `output/v9_lora/summary.csv`. Mean Δ / sev-5 Δ (over seeds, ± sample std):
  drift-weighted 0.1598±0.0158 / 0.2789±0.0168 at 336K params (0.39%) vs uniform r8
  0.1607±0.0209 / 0.2756±0.0096 at 442K (0.51%) vs late-only r8 0.0730±0.0096 /
  0.0944±0.0284 at 110K (0.13%). Verdict: **parity with uniform while training 24%
  fewer params** (paired drift−uniform −0.0009±0.0051); the seed-42 edge did not
  replicate; **late-only is far short** — drift is distributed across depth, not
  confined to the last blocks. Second backbone confirming the ViT-S
  parity-at-lower-cost story (RESEARCH §6.1).
- [ ] v9 paper-grade extension: sublayer-resolved allocation (mlp+attn targets ranked by
  the v8 profiles, the §5.1-motivated variant) + §1.4 ablation set (β^τ, top-k,
  inverted-β falsification) — multi-seed done (42/43/44).
- Claims it closes: (a) the current paper's ViT-B generality item; (b) first
  cross-architecture profile pair (ViT-S vs ViT-B).
- Fold into RESEARCH §6 + the future framework paper as the ViT data point.

### Track 3 — Cross-family drift profiles (the centerpiece; ~5–10 GPU-hours)
**Models (timm, all ≤ 90M):** ResNet-50, ConvNeXt-Tiny, ViT-S/16, Swin-Tiny, DeiT-S
(+ ViT-B/14 from Track 2; + one state-space/Mamba vision model if accessible).
**Protocol:** same ImageNet-val 10k subset (cached fp16 features), synthetic
low_light/jpeg severity pairs, per-stage/per-block CKA + proxy profiles.
- **The finding reviewers cannot get elsewhere:** do CNNs drift early and ViTs late?
  Hybrid/state-space in between? This is the cross-architecture claim.
- Output: the profile atlas (`output/profiles/<model>_<corruption>.csv`) +
  `docs/DPA_DESIGN.md` §2 + the paper's Fig. 1.
- Cost control: forward-only, cached features, one Kaggle session per 2 models.

### Track 4 — SSR: selective statistic recalibration (label-free; ~5–8 GPU-hours)
- Store clean per-module channel statistics (μ, σ) once per model.
- At test time: estimate illumination shift from a few unlabeled batches → recalibrate
  **only top-k drift modules** (per-channel affine or norm-stat replacement); gate =
  0 on clean inputs (exactly-identity guarantee).
- Baselines: TENT, BN-adapt (adapt-all), enhancement front-ends (ZeroDCE/CLAHE),
  augmentation-only FT. Ablations: proxy-vs-CKA profiler, top-k vs all, gate on/off.
- This is the cheapest method arm and the one that makes the framework "label-free".

### Track 5 — Real-darkness dense eval (the credibility arm; ~3–5 GPU-hours)
- ACDC night + Dark Zurich (segmentation, eval-only with a frozen SegFormer/DeepLab
  head + SSR recalibration), DarkFace/ExDark-detection (detection, norm-layer-only).
- Datasets hosted on Kaggle where possible (no download quota pain; check licenses).
- This directly answers "your problem is synthetic" — the advisor's #1 acceptance risk.

### Track 6 — Manuscript
- Framing: **"Drift-Profiled, Label-Free Adaptation: where representation damage
  lives determines where adaptation pays"** — diagnostic (profiles) → allocation
  (LoRA/routing) → label-free repair (SSR) → cross-architecture atlas → real-dark.
- Target: CVPR/ICCV main; fallbacks: UG2+/NTIRE workshops, journal. Advisor's honest
  caveat stands: breadth + seeds + real benchmarks substitute for scale.
- Assemble from: RESEARCH.md (narrative), DPA_DESIGN.md (method), PAPER_RELATED_WORK.md
  (related work, re-scope after prior-art searches), upstream's paper/ skeleton post-merge.

## 3. Execution order and dependencies

```
Track 0 (done: blur re-evals folded, PR #1 merged) ──┐
Track 1 (drift proxy, ResNet-50)  ── gate ────┤
Track 2 (ViT-B v8/v9, Kaggle)                 ├──→ Track 3 (atlas) ──→ Track 4 (SSR)
                                              │                            │
                                              └── PR #1 merge ──────────→ Track 5 (ACDC/DarkZurich)
                                                                               │

```

- **Track 1 gates Track 3's proxy claim only** (not the atlas — CKA profiles can start
  immediately). Run Track 1 *concurrently* with Track 2 (proxy work is CPU/1-session).
- Tracks 2 and 3 share the profiling harness — build it once (`run_drift_profile.py`,
  model-agnostic via timm), parameterize by model.
- Track 4 needs Track 3's profiles (top-k selection). Track 5 needs Track 4's method.
- Two Kaggle sessions/week cadence: one profiling session + one method session.

## 4. GPU / compute budget (free tier, per advisor's table)

| Block | Cost | Sessions (30 h/wk quota) |
|---|---|---|
| ViT-B profile + LoRA arms (Track 2) | 2–4 GPU-h | 1 |
| Cross-family profiles, 6 models (Track 3) | 5–10 GPU-h | 1–2 |
| SSR arms, 6 models × 3 datasets × 3 seeds (Track 4) | 5–8 GPU-h | 2 |
| Dense-task eval (Track 5) | 3–5 GPU-h | 1 |
| **Total** | **~15–27 GPU-h** | **~2–3 weeks** |

Compute tricks (from the memo, adopt wholesale): ImageNet-val subsets (10–20k) with
cached fp16 features; `torch.autocast` + `channels_last`; adapt only top-k modules
(short backward); checkpoint to `/kaggle/working` every N steps; Kaggle for long jobs,
Colab for iteration; multi-seed jobs as separate short sessions emitting JSONs.

---

## 5. Archive (explicitly parked, with reasons)

- **Illumination-Routed Adapters** — not discarded: it is DPA's allocation applied to
  *routing*; becomes the end-game ablation ("routing vs uniform vs allocation-by-rank")
  once DPA/SSR results exist. Prior-art search required before any novelty claim
  (Mixture-of-LoRA / input-conditional adapters are adjacent).
- **Illumination Registers** — highest novelty, highest risk (needs pretraining-scale
  resources; distinctness from artifact-sink registers unproven). Revisit post-paper.
- **Illumination Canonicalizer** — deprioritized by the compute memo (backprop through
  the frozen model × many model pairs = most expensive path). The cross-model transfer
  hook is the only part worth revisiting.
